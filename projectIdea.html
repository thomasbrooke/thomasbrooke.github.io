<h1>Project Idea</h1> <!h1 is a large heading>


<p>Car Logger</p>
<p class="typing">
Although similar smartphone apps already exist primarily for businesses, my project idea is a more enthusiast based logging and tracking application for basic car maintenance as 
well as minor vehicle diagnostics. The app would have users be able to track the service schedule for their vehicle by logging different maintenances, 
and automatically tracking the users driving Kilometres, as well as giving push notifications when a service is near. With time I would like the app to allow 
the user to enter the make and model of their car, and be provided with a list of suitable fluids and service parts for the vehicle though that may be, though this may be
 unfeasible with the limited knowledge I have now.
</p class="typing">

<p>Motivation</p>
<p class="typing">
As a car enthusiast, I try and save dollars everywhere I can by doing services and repairs myself. This is great, until you forget whether your last service was five or eight 
thousand K’s ago, or until a spark plug goes dead due to forgetfulness. I would love an app that tracks every serviceable part in my car and tells me a week or two in advance 
when an oil change, a wheel bearing, or an air filter is due. Being a home mechanic also means your handiwork is rolling side by side at 100 kilometres an hour, and who knows 
how many accidents could have been avoided had somebody known that their car may need some new parts.
</p class="typing">

<p>Description</p>
<p class="typing">
The app would start users off at a home screen, where they are first asked to set up a profile for the vehicles they own or are responsible for, this would include the make, model, 
year, and options. Once they have entered the vehicle’s details, they will then be presented with a list of service items, with boxes to enter when the last service was done, what 
the service interval is, and which specific parts and fluids are needed. The app will also have an option to ‘default’ out to a safe service interval and will present the user with
 a warning if they do not have information on when a part was serviced last. This will include engine oil, oil/fuel/air/cabin filter, brake fluid/pads/disks/drums, battery, tyres, 
 spark plugs, engine coolant, transmission oil, differential oil, wheel bearings, fuel filter, timing belt/chain, valve clearance, power steering fluid, drive belt, and clutch fluid. 
 As well as providing regular updates to check on things such as coolant hoses, belts, lights, wipers, rubber bushings and other suspension components that wear over time but may not 
 have a specific service interval, as well as running diagnostic scans regularly.
<br>
The app will ask the driver weekly for an odometer reading off the car, and will provide notifications based off of that reading plus the service schedule for parts. The app will 
also provide the option to track the drivers movements through GPS to provide push notifications to recommend services to certain parts to avoid the user having to constantly input
 their odometer reading, and to further improve the safety of the app.  
<br>
Eventually if I continue to work on this app as a project, I would like the app to pull data from VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and registration plate databases so that the
 user could enter either their registration number or VIN and have their vehicle automatically added to the system. It would then pull information from the manufacturer’s service 
 information to quickly fill in all of the service parts and fluids so the user doesn’t have to do anything manually.
<br>
Hopefully this app would help encourage people to learn more about their vehicles, assist home mechanics in keeping their heads clear of odometer readings, as well as making the 
road a safer place for everybody.

<p>Tools and Technologies</p>
<p class="typing">
The only hardware needed for this app would be a computer to design it on, and an android phone to run it. I am unfamiliar with the practices for creating android apps at the moment, 
but I will likely use a service like Adobe PhoneGap to build the app. 
</p class="typing">

<p>Skills Required</p>
<p class="typing">
I will need to learn all of the ins and outs of Java, as it is the official programming language of Android. This should be feasible as there are many websites, such as w3schools and
 codeacademy that offer free tutorials on how to code in Java. utc
</p class="typing">

<p>Outcome</p>
<p class="typing">
If my app ends up being successful, home mechanics all over the world will be able to rest easy knowing that every serviceable part of their car is trackable in one easy to find location,
 and will no longer be constantly second guessing themselves as to whether it is time to swap out a certain part or not. It will hopefully also reduce traffic incidents due to
 mechanical neglect, and may also encourage those that are not so mechanically inclined to have a look at their car and start learning about the machine they trust to safely carry 
 their lives to wherever they are headed.
