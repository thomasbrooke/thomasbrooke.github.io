<p class="typing"> 
My name is Tom Brooke, I am 21 years old and currently living in Bendigo, VIC. I was born in Melbourne but spent most of my life living in Brisbane until I moved here at age 16.
 Since leaving high school I’ve spent most of my time working in retail and factory jobs, and I’ve started this course as I think it could greatly broaden my horizons in life.
