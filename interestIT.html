<h1>Interest in IT</h1> <!h1 is a large heading>

<p class="typing">
I have been interested in computers and IT from a very young age. I vaguely remember being about 12 years old, thinking I was the best after successfully pulling apart my school laptop, removing the hard drive and RAM (without knowing what they were), and putting it all back together without destroying the thing. 
<br><br>
What originally got me into computers was gaming, specifically learning about the technical specs of computers and understanding all of the different parts and how they work together. At age 14 I spent a week putting up fences at my grandfather’s farm to get together some money to build my first gaming PC. And from ages 14 to 16, my computer was my life. This obsession led to me studying IT through my time in high school, where I learned a few basic programming languages and came to an understanding of how computers and programs work behind the scenes. Since leaving high school I have forgotten much of the basic coding I learned, but still have a solid grasp of how programs work. Being more mature now I can see the broad potential of having a degree in IT and how I could apply that in my life. 
<br><br>
I chose to study at RMIT as I applied though Open Universities, who offered me a few different courses through various Universities, but this course and RMIT stood out to me because I have heard both through the school’s reputation but also my brother and other friends who have gone on to study there that it is a great environment and students are treated well.
<br><br>
I hope during my studies to gain a more solid grasp of IT systems and in particular, learn to code at a high level in various languages to broaden my opportunities going on in life.
