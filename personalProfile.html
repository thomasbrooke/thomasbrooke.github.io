What do the results of these tests mean for you?

For me, these tests have confirmed a lot of what I thought was true about myself, I tend to think things through logically and analyse all the possible results of a situation.
 I always try to be honest with others even when it may hurt their feelings if I think it will be beneficial for them. I don’t consider myself much of a leader as I lack confidence,
 but I try to speak up when I think something is wrong and I will always do my best to lead others in the right direction.

<p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>

When I am working in a team, I tend to be very reserved, until there is a problem or some action needs to be taken. In some situations this can be advantageous, such as when the
 workflow is moving fluidly I tend not to get in the way or cause distractions, but it can also lead to me not putting in my two cents when perhaps I should.

<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
<p class="typing">
  <img src="images/careerquiz1.png" alt="Career Quiz" style="width:500px"> 
I tend to work well in a team with a few natural leaders, as I tend to stay quiet unless needed and I don’t usually feel confident telling others what to do.
 When I feel comfortable I will talk to the leaders about things that I think could be done better but for the most part I tend to put my head down and do what needs
 to be done, and maybe try to help anyone who is struggling.
